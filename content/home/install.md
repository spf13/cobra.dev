Using Cobra is easy. First, use `go get` to install the latest version
of the library. This command will install the `cobra` generator executable
along with the library and its dependencies:

    go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra

Next, include Cobra in your application:

```go
import "github.com/spf13/cobra"
```
